Initial performance:

Single processor, no network:

Difficulty: 7 zero hex digits
20,445,043,024 clocks = 3 min 25 sec
Nonce = 18deaa4 = 26,077,860
3 hashes/nonce
Total hashes = 26,077,860*3 = 78,233,580
Hash rate = 78233580/205 sec = 0.381627 Mhash/s
Less than 5% FPGA area utilization
Total on-chip power = 0.157W
